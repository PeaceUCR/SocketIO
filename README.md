# /passport
**passport-local.js**
use the local db for authenticate

http://www.passportjs.org/docs/configure/

**done()** https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32153865/what-is-done-callback-function-in-passport-strategy-configure-use-function

passport.use('local.signup'...
http://www.passportjs.org/docs/username-password/

**passport-google.js**

http://www.passportjs.org/docs/google/
use the google oauth for authenticate

function (req, token, refreshToken, profile, done)
no err, just done with google user


# /public 
just npm run build files from SocketIOUI reactjs project


# /routes
**index.js**

`router.get(['/gate','/user/*','/room/*'])`
render view html


router.get('/currentuser')get current user from session


//https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15388206/sending-back-a-json-response-when-failing-passport-js-authentication

custome set json response when use xhr the passport authenticate

http://www.passportjs.org/docs/authenticate/

router.post('/login')

passport.authenticate('local.signup', {failWithError: true}),

router.post('/signup')

passport.authenticate('local.signup', {failWithError: true}),

**'local.login'or 'local.signup' match the name strategy in passport-local.js**

**{failWithError: true} if authenticate fail, it will go to the err callback function**



router.get('/auth/google'

router.get('/auth/google/callback'

authenticate use the google strategy



**user.js**

//get user by id

router.post('/user'

//get most recent 10 message for  a user

router.post('/message'
